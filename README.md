# Rim Repair Booking Automation

Automated booking system for mobile rim repair business.

## What it does

1. Polls Gmail every 60 seconds for new customer emails
2. Uses Claude AI to extract booking details (name, vehicle, date, address, service)
3. If details are incomplete, auto-replies to customer requesting missing info
4. Sends you an SMS with booking details for YES/NO confirmation
5. On YES: creates Google Calendar event + sends customer confirmation SMS + email
6. On NO: sends customer a polite decline message
7. If you reply with corrections (e.g. "change time to 11am"), updates booking and re-confirms
8. Sends customer a reminder SMS the day before their booking
9. Sends customer a Google review request ~3 hours after job completion

## Owner SMS Commands

When you receive a booking request SMS:
- Reply `YES` → confirms booking, creates calendar event, notifies customer
- Reply `NO` → declines booking, notifies customer
- Reply with any correction → e.g. `change time to 2pm`, `address is 14 Smith St Balcatta` → updates booking and re-sends for confirmation
